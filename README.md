# Terraform Helper (v2)

## Overview
tfhelper-v2 is a Go-based command-line tool built with Cobra.

It's the second project in a three-part series exploring Terraform, Go, and Azure integration.

The goal is to create a lightweight CLI that wraps Terraform workflows, starting with setup and validation, then expanding to plan, apply, and log management.

## Current Phase: Scaffold Complete
Phase 1 established the foundation: 
- Go module initialized and structured with Cobra
- Root command generated (cmd / root.go)
- Builds and runs successfully inside Azure Cloud Shell
- Repository connected to GitHub for version control

At this stage, the CLI runs and responds to help output, confirming the framework is wired correctly.
